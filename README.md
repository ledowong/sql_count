# Issue
`count` value is incorrect, when using `joins` and `group` together, and group by multi-table ID.
The following example, expected return **5**, but Rails `count` return **4**.
Cross checked in SQL database, it return **5** rows.

# Steps to reproduce
## Setup
Checkout this sample project, then run the following in console:
```
bundle
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

It create Products and Skus table, and create sample record in DB. You should have something like this in database:
![products](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ledowong/sql_count/master/Screenshot%202018-09-26%20at%2012.42.57%20PM.png)
![skus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ledowong/sql_count/master/Screenshot%202018-09-26%20at%2012.42.59%20PM.png)

Models are simple:
```
class Sku < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :product
end

class Product < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :skus
end
```
## Reproduce in rails console
Run `Sku.joins(:product).group("skus.id, products.id").size` in rails console, it generate a COUNT SQL, and return a hash, which I guess it means 4. (kaminari return 4 too. https://github.com/kaminari/kaminari/issues/968)
But if I `load` it into memory first, and call `size` again, it return 5, which is expected.
![console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ledowong/sql_count/master/Screenshot%202018-09-26%20at%2012.55.51%20PM.png)

I copy the above SQL, which generated by ORM, and run it in SQL tool (TablePlus), it return 5 rows.

## Reproduce in kaminari
http://localhost:3000/?page=5
It shows `Displaying sku 5 - 4 of 4 in total`

# Sample explanation
This example JOIN and GROUP BY both table IDs, I know this usage doesn't make sense. The actual use case is much more complex JOIN, and GROUP BY more columns (including both table IDs). I try to simplifies it, to just a simple JOIN and GROUP BY. Although this sample's GROUP BY look odd, but it is simple and correct Rails syntax.
